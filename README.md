so basically an API enables programs to share information without necessarily going through any backend activities , it can also be used to extend functionality. so it acts as a middleware . 

it is also the set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other .

to use an API , you will need to authenticate yourself and prevent unauthorized access. apis often require api keys, oauth and a token normally json web token in order to fully make use of an api.


# DOM MANIPULATION

creating an element in js is not the same as adding the element to the page .if you want to add the element to the page then you have to make use of the appendChild.

the difference between the [append] and the [appendChild] is that with the append you can add strings to the page but you cant do that with the [appendChild]. with the appendChild you can only add elements after you have created them. 

also you can also user the [innerText] and [textContent] to add text or strings to the element you have created . they all work perfectly but there is a slight difference.
the innertext prints the exact text visible on the page whereas the textContent prints all all visible and hidden on the page. 

in addition if you want to make use of the html tag too you can use the [innerHTML] and then add the tag to them .
